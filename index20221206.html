   <div class = "descript">The climate information presented here is for a location in the Bellcrest section
        of Toms River. The climate record here started in 1978 with high and low temperatures recorded
        with human read thermometers. Records are spotty in the late 1970s into the mid 1980s as there
        was not always someone available to take the readings. High and low temperature readings were 
        semi automated in 1989, and fully automated with the deployment of the first Davis Weather station.<br><br>
        Rainfall was first recorded in 1989 with the purchase of an 8 inch rain gauge and was then was automated by 
        the use of the Davis Weather station.
