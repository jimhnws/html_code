   <div class = "descript">The climate information presented here is for a location in the Bellcrest section
                of Toms River. The climate record here started in 1978 with high and low temperatures recorded
                with human read thermometers. Records are spotty in the late 1970s into the mid 1980s as there
                was not always someone available to take the readings. High and low temperature readings were 
                semi automated in 1989, and fully automated with the deployment of the first Davis Weather station.
            
                Rainfall was first recorded in 1989 with the purchase of an 8 inch rain gauge and was then was automated by 
                the use of the Davis Weather station.
